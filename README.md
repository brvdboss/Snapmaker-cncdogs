# Snapmaker-cncdogs
 clamping dogs for the cnc wasteboard of the snapmaker2
 
 This provides a set of clamping tools to secure your stock on the snapmaker cnc wasteboard.
 There are variants for the small holes (where the screws go to mount the wasteboard) and the larger holes where the provided clamps fit
 
 The spirals are used to put additional pressure on one side and come in different sizes to adjust for all your clamping needs
 For these the "keys" are used to make them universal for every type of hole in the wasteboard.  The smallest spiral is designed so it can be used on the holes closest to the side and still clear the vertical axes.
 
 To tighten the clamps a handle is provided to make that easier with the same keyhole.
 This handle can also be used as a wedge to secure your material.


## Why use this?
If you have a piece of material that you can't clamp from the top down or need to secure from the side, for example to align it more easily.
It's from plastic. If your bits do drill in to this, they probably won't get damaged.

## Overview of elements
- **cornerdog**: element to fix the corner of your material. Both in large and small hole variant
- **dog**: align on the side of your material. Both in large and small hole variant
- **spiralhandle**: handle to tighten the pressurespirals.  You can also use this as a wedge in combination with a dog to the fix the material.
- **turnkey**: the "key" that locks in the holes. Both in a large and small hole variant
- **turnkeyspiral**: the actual pressure spiral, insert a key, put it in the hole and turn with the spiralhandle.  Different sizes available

Where possible all objects are parameterized so they can easily be adjusted in size

## What to watch out for when using this
- These clamps only apply pressure from the side. Depending on the material, tolerance in your dogholes.  Often the material has a tendency to be pushed upwards.
- The holes in the waste board are small and not very deep, in addition the waste board is rather soft.  Don't put huge amounts of pressure on it.
- When fixing your material also push it down while clamping and check you push the dogs down to make sure everything is secure. You could use one of the snapmaker provide clamps to push down on the pressure weels to get some more downforce on the material.

## How to print
Printing everything using the defaul fast profile in Luban seems to work fine and everything fits snuggly together. (tested with snapmaker provided white filament)
