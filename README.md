# Snapmaker-cncdogs
 clamping dogs for the cnc wasteboard of the snapmaker2
 
 This provides a set of clamping tools to secure your stock on the snapmaker cnc wasteboard.
 There are variants for the small holes (where the screws go to mount the wasteboard) and the larger holes where the provided clamps fit
 
 The spirals are used to put additional pressure on one side and come in different sizes to adjust for all your clamping needs
 For these the "keys" are used to make them universal for every type of hole in the wasteboard.  The smallest spiral is designed so it can be used on the holes closest to the side and still clear the vertical axes.
 
 To tighten the clamps a handle is provided to make that easier with the same keyhole.
 This handle can also be used as a wedge to secure your material.

 An additional version has been added with a through-hole that fits an m4 screw. this allows to fix the "large" dogs & turnkeys to fixed to the board.  This improves the clamping force significantly. and eliminates the risk of the dogs coming loos through vibration.  It does mean clamping is no longer "toolless"
 The screws are countersunk rather deep to minimize the risk of your drill hitting it if you go through the plastic and this also helps with the rigidity as the screwhead provides additional strenght in the doghole.


## Why use this?
If you have a piece of material that you can't clamp from the top down or need to secure from the side, for example to align it more easily.
It's from plastic. If your bits do drill in to this, they probably won't get damaged.

## Overview of elements
- **cornerdog**: element to fix the corner of your material. Both in large and small hole variant. For the large version there is now also a through-hole version.
- **dog**: align on the side of your material. Both in large and small hole variant. For the large version there is now also a through-hole variant.
- **spiralhandle**: handle to tighten the pressurespirals.  You can also use this as a wedge in combination with a dog to the fix the material.
- **turnkey**: the "key" that locks in the holes. Both in a large and small hole variant. For the large version there is now also a through-hole variant.
- **turnkeyspiral**: the actual pressure spiral, insert a key, put it in the hole and turn with the spiralhandle.  Different sizes available

Where possible all objects are parameterized so they can easily be adjusted in size
There are no throughole variants of the small versions of the clamps as those holes are used to mount the wasteboard.

## What to watch out for when using this
- These clamps only apply pressure from the side. Depending on the material, tolerance in your dogholes.  Often the material has a tendency to be pushed upwards.  The through hole versions mostly minimize this, but require M4 screws
- The holes in the waste board are small and not very deep, in addition the waste board is rather soft.  Don't put huge amounts of pressure on it.
- When fixing your material also push it down while clamping and check you push the dogs down to make sure everything is secure. You could use one of the snapmaker provide clamps to push down on the pressure weels to get some more downforce on the material.
- You can use the M4 screws included with the snapmaker to fixate the through-hole versions. They are just long enough, a tiny bit longer would have been conventient though.

## How to print
Printing everything using the defaul fast profile in Luban seems to work fine and everything fits snuggly together. (tested with snapmaker provided white filament)
